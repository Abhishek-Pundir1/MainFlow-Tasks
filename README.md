DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON- TASK-1

Description:-
  This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
  
Responsibility:-
  Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.

Learning about lists, dictionaries, and sets involves understanding their characteristics, uses, and how to manipulate them in programming. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:  

Lists
Definition: An ordered collection of items that can be of mixed data types.
Key Concepts:
Indexing: Accessing elements by their position (0-based index).
Mutability: Lists can be modified (adding, removing, or changing elements).
Methods: Common methods include append(), remove(), sort(), and extend().

Dictionaries
Definition: An unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
Key Concepts:
Key-Value Association: Accessing values using keys.
Mutability: Dictionaries can also be modified (adding or removing key-value pairs).
Methods: Common methods include get(), keys(), values(), and items().

Sets
Definition: An unordered collection of unique items.
Key Concepts:
Uniqueness: Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values.
Mutability: You can add or remove elements, but sets themselves are mutable.
Operations: Supports mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Learning Objectives
Manipulation Skills: Learn how to create, update, and delete elements in each structure.
Problem-Solving: Apply these data structures to solve real-world problems, such as data organization and retrieval.
Efficiency: Understand the performance implications of using different structures for various tasks.
